# Vehicle-detection-using-CNN
This repo contains the dataset and code of my final year project "Vehicle detection using CNN" as partial fulfillment of Msc in IT from the department of computer science, gauhati university


## Dataset
I used a publicly available dataset for vehicle and non-vehicle detection. The dataset is available in the `data` directory.

## Notebooks

We trained three different machine learning models to classify vehicle and non-vehicle. For more details about the models and their performance, refer to the project report in the `documentation` directory.

- `Mysequential_CNN.ipynb`: G-colab Notebook for vehicle detection using sequentail personal customized CNN model.
- `vehicleDetection_EffNetB0.ipynb`: G-colab Notebook for vehicle detection using customized efficientNetB0 model.
- `vehicleDetection_VGG16.ipynb`: G-colab Notebook for vehicle detection using  customized VGG16 model.
